Example: 

<example_question>
How can we develop more accurate climate models to better predict and mitigate the effects of global warming?
</example_question>

<example_path1>
Path 1: Improve representation of aerosol effects in climate models
1. Conduct field campaigns using unmanned aerial vehicles to sample aerosol concentrations and properties at different altitudes
2. Analyze aerosol samples using mass spectrometry and electron microscopy to determine chemical composition and microphysical structure
3. Perform laboratory chamber experiments to study aerosol formation, growth, and interactions under controlled conditions 
4. Develop aerosol microphysics models incorporating new data on composition, size distributions, and optical properties
5. Implement improved aerosol models in climate simulations and evaluate impacts on radiative forcing estimates
6. Constrain aerosol models using observations of aerosol optical depth from ground and satellite remote sensing
</example_path1>

<example_reasoning1>
Atmospheric aerosols have complex effects on the climate through radiative forcing and cloud processes, but are poorly constrained in models. An integrated approach combining in-situ measurements, controlled experiments, aerosol modeling, and observational constraints can significantly improve aerosol representation for more reliable climate projections.
</example_reasoning1>  

<example_challenges1>
- Aerosol properties are highly variable, requiring extensive sampling across diverse regions 
- Simulating detailed aerosol microphysics is computationally expensive for climate model runs
- Uncertainties in aerosol emissions, transport, and removal processes propagate through models
</example_challenges1>

<example_path2>
Path 2: Incorporate impacts of permafrost thaw on carbon cycle feedbacks
1. Measure rates of permafrost degradation and carbon emissions in Arctic field studies
2. Determine temperature sensitivities of permafrost carbon release using warming experiments  
3. Model permafrost carbon contributions under various climate change scenarios
4. Couple permafrost carbon cycle model with climate model simulations
5. Use observed positive correlation between mean tropical land temperature and CO2 growth rate to validate model outputs
</example_path2>

<example_reasoning2>
Thawing permafrost could release vast amounts of greenhouse gases, amplifying global warming through carbon cycle feedbacks. Integrating improved models of this process into climate projections is crucial for understanding potential climate change trajectories and impacts.
</example_reasoning2>

<example_challenges2>
- Difficulty measuring and modeling carbon emissions from heterogeneous permafrost regions
- Potential non-linear or threshold effects as permafrost thaw accelerates
- Uncertainties in temperature projections propagate into carbon cycle feedback estimates
</example_challenges2>

Example 2:

<example_question_2>
How can we develop more effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's?
</example_question_2>

<example_path_1>
Path 1: Identify novel therapeutic targets via multi-omics data integration

Collect biosamples (brain tissue, CSF, blood) from Alzheimer's patients and age-matched controls
Perform RNA-sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics profiling on biosamples
Preprocess omics data and perform quality control, normalization, and batch effect removal
Integrate multi-omics data using computational tools like similarity network fusion
Overlay integrated omics profiles onto protein-protein interaction networks
Prioritize dysregulated subnetworks and identify key driver genes/proteins as potential targets
Validate top targets using CRISPR gene editing in patient-derived cellular disease models
Propose a drug screening pipeline focused on validated targets for hit identification </example_path_1>
<example_reasoning_1>
By integrating multi-omics data, we can gain a systems-level view of the dysregulated molecular networks underlying Alzheimer's pathology. This unbiased approach could reveal novel targets that conventional methods may have missed, leading to innovative treatment strategies.
</example_reasoning_1>

<example_challenges_1>

Acquiring high-quality, well-annotated biosamples is costly and requires careful study design
Computational integration of disparate omics data types is complex and error-prone
Many potential targets may be difficult to modulate with existing drug chemistries
Cellular disease models may not fully recapitulate human disease complexity </example_challenges_1>
<example_path_2>
Path 2: Develop immunotherapies targeting pathological protein aggregates

Identify specific epitopes on misfolded amyloid-beta and tau aggregates using techniques like:
Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry
Antibody scanning/mutation scanning
Computational structure prediction of aggregated conformations
Generate therapeutic antibodies targeting these epitopes using:
Phage/yeast display of antibody libraries
Humanization of lead antibody candidates
Engineer antibodies for improved brain exposure:
Increase antibody plasma half-life
Enhance receptor-mediated transcytosis across blood-brain barrier
Evaluate lead antibody candidates in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's:
Assess binding/clearing of protein aggregates via PET imaging
Measure effects on cognitive deficits and pathology
Initiate clinical trials for safe, brain-penetrant antibodies showing in vivo efficacy </example_path_2>
<example_reasoning_2>
Abnormal protein aggregation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Immunotherapies using antibodies to target and clear these toxic aggregates could potentially slow or reverse disease progression by addressing a key underlying pathology.
</example_reasoning_2>

<example_challenges_2>

Identifying optimal epitopes on aggregated, misfolded protein conformations is difficult
Engineering antibodies to cross the blood-brain barrier remains highly challenging
Potential neuroinflammatory side effects from antibody-mediated clearance of protein aggregates
Removing existing aggregates may not prevent formation of new aggregates </example_challenges_2>
