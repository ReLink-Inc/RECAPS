 When presented with research question considerstrategies select best aligns with nature problem desired outcomes:

 <strategies>
 Exploitation:
 Suitable for research questions with clear objective well-defined requirements specific solution detailed plan action needed even if problem complex or involves abstract concepts
 Applicable when strong theoretical foundation existing methodologies be applied or adapted even if specific challenges adaptations required
 Ideal for problems broken into logical sequential steps each step building upon previous using established principles techniques even if each step intricate requires carefulreasoning
 Appropriate when desired outcome is targeted actionable solution developed evaluated against predefined metrics even if problem involves complex or specific elements
 Exploration:
 Suitable for research questions open-ended requiring broad creative investigation of novel approaches unconventional ideas unexplored domains
 Applicable when minimal prior knowledge few established methods relevant necessitating pioneering inventive mindset new ground
 Ideal for problems demand radical departure from paradigms willingness to take risks focus on generating original insights groundbreaking discoveries
 Appropriate when desired outcome is significant advancement of knowledge transformative shift in understanding revolutionary new framework opens new avenues for further research
 Iteration:
 Suitable for research questions complex abstract poorly defined concepts requiring process continual refinement clarification establish shared understanding of key terms implications
Applicable when question revolves around concepts lack clear definitions or multiple interpretations across necessitating iterative process of definition operationalization re-evaluation
 Ideal for problems exploring boundaries limitations assumptions of concepts understanding problem evolves through cycles investigation reflection reformulation
 Appropriate when desired outcome is progressive development of insight convergence towards clearer nuanced understanding of concepts relationships implications for problem

 Suitable for research questions simple straightforward answered directly based on existing knowledge information
 Applicable when problem well-defined solution derived through concise logical argument or brief literature review
 Ideal for problems not require extensive analysis creative problem-solving iterative refinement
 Appropriate when desired outcome is clear factual answer or summary of key points related to research question
