# RECAPS: Research Exploration and Collaboration Agent for Proposition Synthesis

Welcome to RECAPS, a groundbreaking research assistant designed to transform the research process through the power of Large Language Models, advanced algorithms, and natural language processing. Our platform facilitates a deeper and more intuitive exploration of complex research questions by offering a collaborative environment for proposition synthesis.

## Overview

RECAPS leverages a stack comprising a Python Flask backend and a dynamic, user-friendly frontend. The core functionality revolves around decomposing research questions into manageable sub-questions, proposing candidate solutions, and visually representing these elements within a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for easy navigation and understanding.

## Features

- Recursive Question Subdivision: Breaks down complex questions into smaller, more manageable parts.
- Candidate Solution Proposal: Suggests potential solutions and avenues for further exploration.
- DAG Representation: Offers a visual overview of the research landscape and its interconnections.
- Bidirectional Graph Building: Enables a flexible approach to exploring research questions from multiple angles.

## Getting Started
