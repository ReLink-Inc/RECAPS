# RECAPS
RECAPS: Research Exploration and Collaboration Agent for Proposition Synthesis
Welcome to RECAPS, a cutting-edge research copilot designed to revolutionize the way researchers approach complex questions and collaborate on projects. Our goal is to streamline the research process by leveraging advanced AI techniques to generate a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of propositions, representing a comprehensive and structured approach to answering research questions.

Key Features
Recursive Question Subdivision: RECAPS intelligently breaks down research questions into smaller, more manageable sub-questions, allowing for a systematic and thorough exploration of the problem space.
Proposition Synthesis: By analyzing relevant documents and data, RECAPS generates candidate solutions and propositions for each sub-question, building a robust foundation for the research process.
Bidirectional Graph Construction: RECAPS can construct the DAG of propositions from both ends â€“ starting from the research question and working towards granular propositions, or starting from basic propositions and building up to a comprehensive conclusion.
Collaborative Research Platform: The DAG representation of the research process enables seamless collaboration among researchers, facilitating knowledge sharing, idea exchange, and collective problem-solving.
How It Works
Input: Provide RECAPS with your research question and a set of relevant documents or data sources.
Question Decomposition: RECAPS analyzes the research question and recursively subdivides it into smaller, more focused sub-questions.
Proposition Generation: For each sub-question, RECAPS processes the provided documents and generates candidate propositions and solutions.
Graph Construction: The generated propositions are organized into a directed acyclic graph, representing the logical flow and dependencies between the various components of the research.
Collaboration: Researchers can collaborate on the project by contributing to the graph, refining propos
