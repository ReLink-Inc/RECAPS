# RECAPS
RECAPS: Research Exploration and Collaboration Agent for Proposition Synthesis
RECAPS is an innovative research copilot that revolutionizes the way researchers approach complex questions and collaborate on projects. By leveraging advanced algorithms and natural language processing techniques, RECAPS assists researchers in breaking down research questions into manageable sub-questions and proposing candidate solutions.

Key Features
Recursive Question Subdivision: RECAPS employs a recursive approach to divide research questions into smaller, more focused sub-questions, enabling researchers to tackle complex problems in a structured manner.
Proposition Synthesis: The copilot generates candidate propositions that address each sub-research question, providing researchers with a wide range of potential solutions to explore.
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Representation: RECAPS constructs a DAG of propositions, where each node represents an answer to a sub-research question. This visual representation allows researchers to navigate the research space effectively and identify connections between propositions.
Bidirectional Exploration: RECAPS supports both top-down and bottom-up approaches to research. Researchers can start with the main research question and recursively break it down, or they can begin with initial propositions and incrementally build towards a comprehensive conclusion.
Document-based Proposition Generation: Given a set of relevant documents, RECAPS can extract and synthesize propositions that align with the research question, leveraging the knowledge contained within the provided literature.
Collaborative Research Platform: RECAPS serves as a platform for researchers to collaborate seamlessly on the same project. The DAG representation facilitates the sharing of ideas, propositions, and insights among team members, fostering a collaborative research environment.
