As an experienced professor-level research lead, your task is to guide researchers in exploring a complex research problem from the most promising alternative perspectives.
The goal is to identify the perspective shifts that have the highest potential to unlock novel insights, approaches, or solutions for the given research question.
Focus on perspectives that are closely related to the problem domain but offer a fresh angle or leverage complementary expertise.

Guidelines:
Thoroughly analyze the research question to identify its core aspects, challenges, and gaps in current understanding or approaches.
Brainstorm a diverse set of alternative perspectives that are closely related to the problem domain but offer a new lens or bring in complementary knowledge and techniques.
Evaluate each perspective based on its potential to provide novel insights, overcome current limitations, or open up promising new directions for addressing the research question.
Select the top 3-5 most promising perspective shifts that have the highest potential to make a significant impact on the problem at hand.
For each selected perspective, articulate how it reframes the research question, what key insights or approaches it brings to the table, and why it holds significant promise for advancing understanding or solutions.
Identify any specific subfields, methods, or technologies associated with each perspective that could be particularly valuable for the research question.
Discuss potential synergies or complementarities between the selected perspectives, exploring how they could be combined or integrated to amplify their impact.

Example:
Research Question: How can we develop more effective and targeted therapies for glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer?

Most Promising Perspective Shifts:
{
    "1": {
        "perspective": "Single-cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics",
        "reframed_question": "How can single-cell genomic profiling and spatial transcriptomic analysis of glioblastoma tumors help identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers for precision medicine approaches?",
        "key_insights": "Single-cell genomics and spatial transcriptomics enable the high-resolution characterization of intratumoral heterogeneity, revealing distinct tumor cell subpopulations, their spatial organization, and their molecular signatures. This perspective shift focuses on understanding the complex ecosystem of glioblastoma tumors at an unprecedented level of detail.",
        "potential_impact": "By dissecting the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of glioblastoma tumors at a single-cell level and in a spatially resolved manner, this perspective holds significant promise for uncovering novel therapeutic targets specific to different tumor cell subpopulations, enabling the development of more precise and effective targeted therapies. It also opens up opportunities for identifying molecular biomarkers that can guide personalized treatment strategies and predict patient outcomes.",
        "specific_aspects": "Single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, tumor microenvironment analysis, bioinformatics and computational biology, precision oncology."
    },
    "2": {
        "perspective": "Immunotherapy and neuroimmunology",
        "reframed_question": "How can we harness the power of the immune system and neuroimmune interactions to develop effective immunotherapies for glioblastoma, overcoming the challenges posed by the blood-brain barrier and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment?",
        "key_insights": "Immunotherapy has shown remarkable success in treating various types of cancer, but its application in glioblastoma has been limited due to the unique challenges of the brain tumor microenvironment. This perspective shift focuses on understanding the complex interplay between the immune system, the central nervous system, and glioblastoma tumors, and leveraging this knowledge to develop innovative immunotherapeutic strategies.",
        "potential_impact": "By deeply interrogating the neuroimmune landscape of glioblastoma and identifying key immunomodulatory pathways and targets, this perspective holds significant promise for unlocking the potential of immunotherapy in this devastating disease. It could lead to the development of novel immune-based therapies, such as engineered T cells, checkpoint inhibitors, or cancer vaccines, that can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, overcome immunosuppression, and elicit potent anti-tumor immune responses.",
        "specific_aspects": "Immuno-oncology, neuroimmunology, tumor microenvironment modulation, cellular immunotherapy, immune checkpoint blockade, cancer vaccines, drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier."
