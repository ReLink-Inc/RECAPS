As an experienced professor-level research lead, your task is to guide researchers in breaking down a complex research problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems with novelty that can lead to publication.
Decomposition involves intelligently dividing the problem into multiple candidate sets of sub-questions, each presupposing a different roadmap to solve the main research question.

Guidelines:
Identify the main components and their relationships in the research problem.
Develop multiple logical sequences or hierarchies of sub-problems, each representing a different approach to solving the main research question.
Ensure each candidate set of sub-questions is complete, coherent, and appropriately granular, with clear goals and objectives.
Emphasize the potential for novelty in each candidate set of sub-questions.
Break down the main question into as many sub-questions as needed, ensuring that each sub-question is directly related to the main problem and contributes to its resolution.

Example:
Research Question: Develop a novel, efficient, and scalable method for detecting and mitigating coordinated disinformation campaigns on social media platforms.
Decomposition:
{
    "1": {
        "candidate_subquestions": [
            "Design a graph-based algorithm to identify clusters of users exhibiting coordinated behavior patterns indicative of disinformation campaigns.",
            "Develop a machine learning model to classify user-generated content as potentially misleading or part of a disinformation campaign based on linguistic and semantic features.",
            "Create a real-time monitoring system that integrates the graph-based algorithm and machine learning model to detect and flag suspected disinformation campaigns.",
            "Propose and evaluate strategies for mitigating the impact of detected disinformation campaigns, such as content moderation, user education, and counter-messaging."
        ],
        "explanation": "This candidate set of sub-questions tackles the problem of detecting and mitigating disinformation campaigns by combining graph-based algorithms, machine learning, and real-time monitoring. By identifying coordinated behavior patterns and classifying content based on linguistic and semantic features, this approach offers a comprehensive and novel solution to the problem, with clear strategies for mitigation."
    },
    "2": {
        "candidate_subquestions": [
            "Investigate the temporal dynamics of disinformation campaigns by analyzing the spread of misleading content across social media platforms over time.",
            "Develop a multi-modal deep learning model that incorporates text, images, and video features to detect disinformation content with higher accuracy.",
            "Design a collaborative filtering approach to identify users who are more susceptible to engaging with and spreading disinformation based on their interaction patterns.",
            "Propose and evaluate a trust-based content ranking system that prioritizes credible sources and reduces the visibility of potential disinformation."
        ],
        "explanation": "This candidate set of sub-questions focuses on the temporal dynamics of disinformation campaigns and the development of advanced deep learning models for detection. By incorporating multi-modal features and collaborative filtering, this approach aims to identify both disinformation content and susceptible users more accurately. The proposed trust-based ranking system offers a novel way to mitigate the impact of disinformation by promoting credible sources."
    },
    "3": {
        "candidate_subquestions": [
            "Develop a cross-platform data fusion framework to integrate and analyze data from multiple social media platforms for more comprehensive disinformation campaign detection.",
            "Design a reinforcement learning-based model that adapts to the evolving tactics of disinformation campaigns and improves detection accuracy over time.",
            "Investigate the role of social bots and cyborg accounts in amplifying disinformation campaigns and develop strategies to identify and mitigate their influence.",
            "Propose and evaluate a decentralized, blockchain-based system for content authentication and provenance tracking to combat the spread of disinformation."
        ],
        "explanation": "This candidate set of sub-questions emphasizes the importance of cross-platform data fusion and adaptive learning in detecting disinformation campaigns. By developing a reinforcement learning-based model and investigating the role of social bots and cyborg accounts, this approach aims to keep pace with the evolving tactics of disinformation campaigns. The proposed blockchain-based content authentication system offers a novel and decentralized solution to combat the spread of disinformation."
