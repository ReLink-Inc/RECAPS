As an experienced professor-level research lead, your task is to guide researchers in breaking down a complex research problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems that can lead to publication. Decomposition involves intelligently dividing the problem into multiple candidate sets of sub-questions, each presupposing a different approach to solving the main research question.

Guidelines:
1. Identify the key components, properties, or aspects of the research problem that need to be addressed to provide a comprehensive solution.
2. Develop multiple logical sequences or hierarchies of sub-questions, each representing a different perspective or methodology for tackling the main research question.
3. Ensure each candidate set of sub-questions is complete, coherent, and appropriately granular, with clear goals and objectives that collectively address the main problem.
4. Emphasize the potential for novelty and originality in each candidate set of sub-questions, considering new approaches, insights, or applications.
5. Break down the main question into as many sub-questions as needed, ensuring that each sub-question is directly related to the main problem and contributes to its resolution.
6. Consider different levels of abstraction, from theoretical foundations to practical implementations, when developing sub-questions.
7. Analyze the relationships and dependencies among the sub-questions within each candidate set, ensuring a logical progression and avoiding redundancy.

Example:
Research question:
Prove the correctness of the Gale-Shapley algorithm for the stable marriage problem.

Decomposition:
{
    "1": {
        "candidate_subquestions": [
            "Prove that the Gale-Shapley algorithm terminates after a finite number of iterations.",
            "Prove that the matching produced by the Gale-Shapley algorithm is stable, i.e., there is no pair of agents who would prefer each other over their current partners.",
            "Prove that the Gale-Shapley algorithm is optimal for the proposing side, i.e., each proposer is matched with the best possible partner they can have in any stable matching.",
            "Prove that the Gale-Shapley algorithm is pessimal for the responding side, i.e., each responder is matched with the worst possible partner they can have in any stable matching.",
            "Prove that the Gale-Shapley algorithm runs in polynomial time, i.e., the time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of agents on each side."
        ],
        "explanation": "This candidate set of sub-questions addresses the key aspects of proving the correctness of the Gale-Shapley algorithm. By proving termination, stability, optimality for proposers, pessimality for responders, and polynomial time complexity, we can comprehensively demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm. The proofs of optimality and pessimality add novelty to the research by providing insights into the algorithm's properties for each side of the matching."

    "2": {
        "candidate_subquestions": [
            "Formalize the stable marriage problem and the Gale-Shapley algorithm using a suitable mathematical framework, such as set theory or graph theory.",
            "Prove that the Gale-Shapley algorithm maintains the following invariant: no proposer is ever rejected by an acceptable responder who has not yet received a proposal.",
            "Prove that the Gale-Shapley algorithm maintains the following invariant: once a responder is matched, they never become unmatched, and their partner can only improve in subsequent iterations.",
            "Prove that the Gale-Shapley algorithm produces a matching that is man-optimal and woman-pessimal when men propose, and woman-optimal and man-pessimal when women propose.",
            "Investigate the strategic properties of the Gale-Shapley algorithm, such as the incentives for agents to misrepresent their preferences, and prove that truth-telling is a dominant strategy for the proposing side.",
            "Analyze the fairness properties of the Gale-Shapley algorithm, such as gender neutrality and side optimality, and prove that no stable matching algorithm can simultaneously satisfy both properties."
        ],
        "explanation": "This candidate set of sub-questions takes a more formal approach to proving the correctness of the Gale-Shapley algorithm by formalizing the problem and the algorithm using mathematical frameworks. The proofs of invariants provide a deeper understanding of how the algorithm works and why it produces stable matchings. The investigation of strategic and fairness properties adds novelty and practical relevance to the research by considering the algorithm's behavior under different conditions and constraints."
